# Disable Sleep on Ubuntu

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when:
- User wants to prevent Ubuntu from sleeping or suspending
- User needs a server or workstation to stay awake indefinitely
- User wants to disable hibernate or hybrid-sleep modes
- User wants to re-enable sleep modes after previously disabling them

## How to disable sleep modes

Run these commands to mask (disable) each sleep target:

```bash
sudo systemctl mask sleep.target
sudo systemctl mask suspend.target
sudo systemctl mask hibernate.target
sudo systemctl mask hybrid-sleep.target
```

Or use the bundled script:

```bash
scripts/manage-sleep.sh disable
```

## How to re-enable sleep modes

Replace `mask` with `unmask`:

```bash
sudo systemctl unmask sleep.target
sudo systemctl unmask suspend.target
sudo systemctl unmask hibernate.target
sudo systemctl unmask hybrid-sleep.target
```

Or use the bundled script:

```bash
scripts/manage-sleep.sh enable
```

## How to check status

Verify the current state of any target:

```bash
systemctl status sleep.target
systemctl status suspend.target
systemctl status hibernate.target
systemctl status hybrid-sleep.target
```

Or use the bundled script:

```bash
scripts/manage-sleep.sh status
```

## Notes

- Requires `sudo` privileges for mask/unmask operations
- Changes persist across reboots
- Masked targets will show as "masked" in status output
